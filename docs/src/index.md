# Hebrew.jl


The type `HebrewOrthography` implements the `OrthographicSystem` interface of the `Orthography` package for Biblical Hebrew texts using the Hebrew range of Unicode.  (For more information about the Julia `Orthography` package, see [its documentation](https://hcmid.github.io/Orthography.jl/stable/)).

Create a `HebrewOrthography` object and use it to get metadata about the orthography, to validate strings, and to tokenize strings.

```@example tour
using Hebrew, Orthography
ortho = HebrewOrthography()
```

!!! warning "Limitations in Documenter's Unicode display"
    Many code points in the Hebrew range of Unicode don't display at all in the font used by Julia's `Documenter` package.  These include all the vowel pointing (*niqqud*), and many of the punctUation and accent marks.  All the code examples in this documentation produce output with fully pointed and accented Hebrew, even if it is not displayed legibly here.



## Valid characters

All 84 defined codepoints in the Unicode Hebrew range plus four white-space characters (space, `\n`, `\r` and `\n`) are valid in this orthography.

```@example tour
codepoints(ortho)
```

Test whether a string is valid in this orthography:

```@example tour
validstring("בֵּֽין־פָּארָ֧ן", ortho)
```

```@example tour
validstring("Hi, בֵּֽין־פָּארָ֧ן", ortho)
```

## Tokenization


The orthography can identify three categories of token:

```@example tour
tokentypes(ortho)
```

Tokenization associates a string value with a token category:

```@example tour
tokens = tokenize("בֵּֽין־פָּארָ֧ן", ortho)
```

!!! note "A note on the preceding output"
    The *maqaf* character does not display will with the fonts used by Julia's `Documenter` system: to verify that the punctuation token in this example in fact has the correct string value, the following block shows its that Unicode codepoint is in fact `05be`, the *maqaf*.

```@example tour
maqaf_string =  tokens[2].text
maqaf_string[1] |> codepoint
```

Numeric tokens are followed by *gershe* or *gershayim*. The following example uses a named character constant and 

```@example tour
aleph = string(Hebrew.aleph_ch)
one = Hebrew.gershe(aleph)
tokenize(one, ortho)
```



- tokenizes characters as lexical, numeric or punctuation tokens. White space characters are thrown away in tokenization
- punctuation tokens are the punctuation character *soph pasuq*, and the character ....  
- numeric tokens are sequences of alphabetic characters followed by *geresh* (for single digits) or *gershayim* (for multi-digit numeric expressions)
- other indications of accent (*ole*, *raphe*, *metheg*, *athnah*), vowel pointing (*niqqud*) and consonants form lexical tokens
